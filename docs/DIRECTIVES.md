## Using directives to modify behavior

Several of the parameters that can be given to the rwloadsim executable
are used to modify the behavior of the RWL*Load Simulator.
A few examples are that ```--statistics``` cause runtime statistics to
be saved and that ```--startseconds``` can be used to set a value for
the common starting time.
These and many other settings can alternatively 
be modified using _directives_ in your rwl source files. 
Directives are instructions to rwloadsim and are handled
purely during scanning of your rwl sources files;
they are not handled by the parser and are not "executed".

All directives have an initial $ followed by a string of characters without
any white space. The characters are lower case letters and in a few
cases contain numerals or punctuation.
Many directive names are terminated by a : followed by a directive value
such as a number.
Directives are never upper case letters; $ followed by upper case are environment
variables.

Many directives can be changed several times in your rwl source files,
which means the actual value will be used on-wards during scanning and parsing.
A directive set in one source file will be applied in subsequent sources files
both when these are on the command line or as include files.

Some examples of directives are:

 * ```$statisitcs:basic``` which has the same effect as the ```--statistics``` option
 * ```$starseconds:<double>``` which has the same effect as the ```--startseconds``` option
 * ```$implicit:both``` which turns on implicit bind and define

Directives for creating useroptions are described in [WORKING.md](WORKING.md) and 
all directives are documented at the ```rwlman directive``` page.

### Conditional compilation

A set of directives, ```$if ... $then```, ```$else```, ```$endif``` are used to 
perform conditional compilation. 
The compile time expression between $if and $then, which can use global variables and 
a small subset of built in functions only, is evaluated during scanning, causing either the first
or second part (after $else) to be parsed; $else and the second part can be
omitted.
The initial $if and $then parts and the compile time expression between them _must_
be on the same source line, but there
are otherwise no restrictions on how these are put in your rwl source file.

A small example of how this can be used is:
```
integer poolsize := 0; $useroption:poolsize

database mydb
  username "username"
  password "{password}"
  connect "//host/service";
  $if poolsize $then
    sessionpool 1 .. poolsize
  $else
    dedicated
  $endif
  default;
```

There are further examples in [MODULAR.md](MODULAR.md).
