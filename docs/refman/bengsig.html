<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">bengsig &minus;
The RWP*Load Simulator primary developer Bj&oslash;rn Kisbye
Engsig.&middot;.</p>

<h2>BIOLOGY
<a name="BIOLOGY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Bj&oslash;rn
Kisbye Engsig was born in 1958, graduated as an engineer in
1983 and has been working with the Oracle database since
1985. In a total of more than twenty-five years, he has been
an employee of Oracle Corporation.</p>

<h2>OLTP
<a name="OLTP"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Measuring
performance and scalability of OLTP workloads has always
been a challenge between simplicity and reality. Mr. Engsig
has been working with and developing several tools for
simulating OLTP database load, and started working on the
RWP*Load Simulator in 2017. Lots of experience from actual
customer workloads and from other ways to investigate in
particular OLTP performance has been a primary driving
motivator for rwloadsim. The difficulty of using SQL*Plus
for this purpose combined with the relatively large time
required to use programming languages like Java or C have
also been taken into account.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In 2020, it was
decided to make rwloadsim publicly available as an addition
to Oracle&rsquo;s already large set of open source
initiatives.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is the hope
that rwloadsim will find its use in many areas of simulation
and measuring of database performance. Additionally, it can
also prove very useful in the more general area of
&quot;scripting&quot; as it fills out the apparent void
between standard UNIX tools such as the shell, awk,
SQL*Plus, and Oracle Call Interface.</p>
