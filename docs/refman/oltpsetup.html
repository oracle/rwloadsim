<h2>OVERVIEW
<a name="OVERVIEW"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This page shows
how to setup and configure the oltp workload that is
included with the RWP*Load Simulator</p>

<h2>PROJECTS
<a name="PROJECTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On the system,
that will be your application server, you will be running
one or several projects that typically differ in how and to
which database they connect. Each project must have a short
name such as dbone, dbtwo, etc. For the rest of the
discussion on this page, the project name <b>key</b> is
used.</p>

<h2>DIRECTORIES
<a name="DIRECTORIES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to run
the oltp workload, you need three directories:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A <b>working
directory</b> where you keep the files that typically get
modified while you use the oltp workload. Each project will
be identified by its name and there will be two files
associated with each project; these files must be stored in
this directory. It is recommended that you create a
directory separately from your home directory, but you can
very well have multiple projects in the same directory as
each project normally just needs those two files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A <b>results
directory</b> that will be filled with sub-directories and
files when you are using the oltp workload. You should have
one directory per project, and you should prepare sufficient
space for up to 0.5MB for each single run you perform. You
normally don&rsquo;t need to inspect or modify any of the
files created.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An <b>awr
directory</b> that will be filled with sub-directories, html
files, graphs, etc while you perform the runs. This
directory must be visible externally via a browser, and it
must be writable by your login user. If you e.g. use Apache
as your web server, the directory typically must exist
somewhere under /var/www/html. You should plan to have
sufficient space for about 2MB plus 2MB per database
instance for each single run. If your webserver runs on a
different system than your runs, the directory can very well
be made available using NFS or similar.</p>

<h2>PREPARATION
<a name="PREPARATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">From your
RWP*Load Simulator distribution, make copies of the two
files from the oltp directory, <b>oltp.env</b> and
<b>oltp.rwl</b> to your working directory, and make the
copies named after your project. If your project it named
<b>key</b>, the files must therefore be named <b>key.env</b>
and <b>key.rwl</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The file
<b>key.env</b> must be modified such that it sets the
environment variable RWLOLTP_NAME to your project name such
as <b>key</b>. If needed, you may also set environment
variables like TNS_ADMIN, TWO_TASK, etc. It is also
recommended to set RWLOADSIM_PATH set (include) your project
working directory.</p>

<h2>EXPERIMENTS
<a name="EXPERIMENTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The otlp
workload is implemented using a combination of shell and rwl
scripts. If you want to experiment with changes to the rwl
scripts, you can create a copy in your working directory of
any of the scripts found in the oltp directory of your
rwloadsim distribution. Doing so implies the script in your
working directory will be used in stead of the one in your
rwloadsim distribution, and you can therefore make those
changes you may find useful. If you do so, it is recommended
that you add a <b>printline</b> command in the beginning of
your modified script to inform about the use of an edited
rwl file.</p>

<h2>PARAMETERS
<a name="PARAMETERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Your projects
parameter file such as <b>key.rwl</b> contains all settings
that define your project including database credentials,
connect strings, workload size, etc. Some settings are
compulsory, others have defaults that you should initially
not change.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
lists all compulsory parameters.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>awrdirectory</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets the name of the directory
where awr, html, graphs, etc will be stored. This is the
directory mentioned above that is visible externally from a
browser.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>resultsdir</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets the name of the results
directory as explained above.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>normal_connect
<br>
pool_connect <br>
batch_connect</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets the connect strings either
in URL style syntax such as //host/service or as names in
tnsnames.ora that will be used when the oltp workload is
executing its ordinary transactions. The first is used in
the few cases where pooling is not in effect, the latter are
used for the vast majority of cases where the transactions
use pooling, pool_connect for the typically short
transactions, batch_connect for the more batch oriented
transactions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In most cases,
the three can be set to the same value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If your
database under test is an autonomous database, you should
choose the connection names that have _tp at the end.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pool_type
<br>
batch_type</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Normally the vast majority of
transactions use session pools as described above. You can
alternatively run either of the two (short and more batch
oriented) using either <b>dedicated</b> or <b>drcp</b>
connections to the database by setting either of these two
parameters to the respective value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
setting either to <b>drcp</b> implies each worker thread
will use its own separate DRCP connection to the database,
and that no ordinary session pool will be created. In this
case, you must include :pooled in URL style connect string
or (server=pooled) in a tnsnames.ora entry; rwloadsim does
not verify this is done.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To achieve the
typical DRCP use case where DRCP is used <i>together</i>
with the session pool for either, you should keep the
respective parameter at its default setting implying a
session pool is used in rwloadsim, but additionally have
:pooled (or server=pooled in tnsnames.ora).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The settings
for DRCP can also be used with cman/tdm, i.e. PRCP.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Do not set
either parameter to any other value.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rwl_min_pool
<br>
rwl_max_pool <br>
rwl_pool_release</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When pool_type is set to its
default value of &quot;sessionpool&quot;, these three
parameters control the size of the normal pool in each
process. The two former set the smallest and highest number
of database sessions in the pool, and the last parameter
sets the timeout after which idle sessions in the pool are
released by disconnecting from the database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The default
values of respectively 3, 10 and 5.0s are normally
appropriate.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>max_sessionwait</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is the maximum time in
seconds a worker thread will wait for a session to be made
available or to be created in the pool. The time may
typically expire if the pool is already at its maximum size
and all other workers spend long time before returning their
session to the pool. This will imply the tranasction will be
dropped with the drop count visible in the persec table with
a vname of &rsquo;call_failure&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The default
value is 30.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cruser_connect</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Is set to the connect string
that will be used when schemas are created and filled with
data. In most cases, it can be the same as the
normal_connect, but if your database is an autonomous
database, using the name with _tpurgent at the end may make
data fill faster as it allows parallel processing.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cruser_username
<br>
cruser_password</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set these to a username
respectively password that will be used for schema creation
combined with the cruser_connect connect string. The typical
username is &quot;system&quot; or &quot;admin&quot; in case
of autonomous databases.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>system_connect
<br>
system_username <br>
system_password</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These will be used during
actual execution of your runs to primarily run queries
against v$ tables etc. The typical username is
&quot;system&quot; or &quot;admin&quot; in case of
autonomous databases. You can normally set them to the same
values as used for schema creation, although the connect
string should be the one ending in _tp in case of an
autonomous database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Unless the next
three parameters are provided, the credentials will also be
used for gathering awr snapshots.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>sysawr_connect
<br>
sysawr_username <br>
sysawr_password</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, awr snapshots and
reporting will use the credentials provided by the three
previous parameters. But if your database is a PDB, and if
you have access to the root container, you should set these
parameters to the credentials for the root rather than for
the PDB. Doing so will make the awr reports more
comprehensive as they include data from all PDBs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you (as
recommended) have a separate database for your RWP*Load
Simulator repository, set these:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>results_in_test
:= 0; <br>
results_connect <br>
results_username <br>
results_password</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Setting results_in_test to zero
implies the repository will not be created in your database
under test. In that case, the other three parameters must be
set to point to your already created repository
database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
perform some quick tests and do not have an existing
RWP*Load Simulator repository, you can set these
parameters:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>results_in_test
:= 1; <br>
results_connect <br>
results_username <br>
results_password <br>
rwloadsim_dir</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Setting results_in_test to
non-zero implies the repository will be created in your
database under test unless one has already been created
there. The three following parameters will be used to create
the repository schema and later to access it. The
rwloadsim_dir parameter must be set to be the full path-name
to the admin directory of your installation of
rwloadsim.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">During
execution, the oltp workload needs five different database
schemas for which you must provide usernames and passwords.
This is done using these ten parameters:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rwl_aw1_username
rwl_aw1_username <br>
rwl_aw2_username rwl_aw2_username <br>
rwl_oe_username rwl_oe_username <br>
rwl_run1_username rwl_run1_username <br>
rwl_run2_username rwl_run2_username</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The usernames can be any
allowed schema names as long as the schemas not already
exists. It is, however, important that the names for the
last two can be identified using a like condition, so these
two are typically named RWLRUN1 and RWLRUN2, as the like
condition RWLRUN_ can be used to identify those. The
usernames must be written in upper case. The passwords must
be chosen to match any password restrictions of your
database.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rwl_run_like</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set to the like condition that
identifies the last two schema names mentioned above. The
like condition must be written in uppercase.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>default_tablespace</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The three first schemas
mentioned above will contain actual data, and they must
therefore have a proper default tablespace configured. This
parameter names that tablespace. A very rough size estimate
is that you will initially need up to 10GB, which mostly
depends on the size of your aw_cols tables. If you are going
to make many runs, size can grow to 100GB or beyond.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The next three
parameters control how big the aw_cols table, how skew the
access to it is, and how many rows are read by each query.
If the table is almost as large as (or even larger then)
your buffer cache, you can get massive reads if there is no
skew in access to the table. The purpose of the settings is
to be able to adjust the actual amount of physical reads in
your database under test. Se the oltp.rwl file for further
information.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>aw_cols_256MB_doublings</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The table is created by first
filling it to roughly 256MB and then doubling it a number of
times; this parameter sets the number of times it gets
doubled from the initial 256MB. The default is 4 resulting
in an aw_cols table of an approximate size of 4GB.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>aw_cols_skew</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If not set, all rows in the
aw_cols table will be uniformly queried. If you set a value,
the rows actually queried will be skewly distributed, the
higher the value, the more skew distribution. With higher
skew, the buffer cache gets more effective. Typical values
are in the range between 5 and several hundred, but you will
normally need to experiment, in particular if your aw_cols
table is as large as or ever larger than your buffer
cache.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if
your aw_cols <i>is</i> so large that it will not fit in your
buffer cache, you cannot completely prevent reads even with
very high values for aw_cols_skew, so the awr report will be
likely to report that your SGA is undersized. It is
debatable if this is a bug or a feature of the oltp
workload, and ideas for a better scheme are welcome.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>aw_cols_query_factor</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This parameter sets the average
number of rows being read in each aw_cols query. Due to the
extremely poor index clustering factor, these rows are
likely to be distributed on the same amount of database
blocks. The default value is 50, which is a good starting
point for experiments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
parameters impact the generated output and graphs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rwl_title</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set to a string that will be
put on all html files, graphs, etc that are generated.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rwl_daily_html</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set to name the file that will
contain daily overviews when using the <a href="oltpday.html">oltpday(2rwl)</a>
utility; it should name a html file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rwl_heading</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set to a string that will be
the heading for the daily reports, generated using
<a href="oltpday.html">oltpday(2rwl)</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
parameters are used to control the actual workload, and they
have reasonable default values. Note that only some
parameters are documented here, there rest are discussed in
the oltp.rwl file that you copied to a file named after your
project such as <b>key.rwl</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ratefactor</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is a double value (default
0.2) that sets the overall workload. You can very
approximately assume that with the default value together
with the default value for <b>threadcount</b>, making runs
with one process will require in the order of 0.2 database
CPU seconds per second.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rategradient</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is a double value that can
be used to make the overall workload increase gradually
during a run. If the value is 0 (or is unset), the arrival
rate will be constant during the run; this is the default
behavior. If the value is set higher than 0 and at most to
1, the arrival rate will initially be <i>lower</i> than
specified via <b>ratefactor</b>, half way through the run it
will be what <b>ratefactor</b> specifies and at the finish
of the run, it will be <i>higher</i>. Effectively, the rate
will gradually increase from 100*rategradient percent below
normal to 100*rategradient percent above normal. Values
outside the range [0;1] will be adjusted to either 0 or
1.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>threadcount</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is an integer value
(default 50) that sets the number of worker threads per
process. If you want to experiment with, as an example,
twice the load, you can do so by doubling either of
<b>ratefactor</b>, <b>threadcount</b>, or the number of
processes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>time_out</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When time_out is set to an
actual value of 0 or more, any transaction that is delayed
by more than the value of <b>time_out</b> seconds will be
<i>dropped</i> in stead of being actually executed. When a
transaction is dropped, no database session will be
acquired, and the transaction is not executed. In stead, the
drop count will be increased by 1. This is only likely to
happen when the datbase is under pressure and when the
actual time to get a database session and execute a
transaction is higher than the inverse of the arrival rate.
The drop count is visible in the persec table with a vname
of &rsquo;call_failure&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
is different from the max_sessionwait parameter which sets
the maximum time a worker will wait for a session.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
parameters with names starting with fix_ have effect when
the execution is fixed at starttime, i.e. when external
control is not used.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>fix_logoffrate</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is a double value that can
be set to increase the logon activity by causing session
release to also disconnect. By default, this does not
happen, but if set to a value in the range ]0;1], the value
sets the proportion of sessions doing the make_order
transaction that will disconnect during session release. The
parameter only has effect when the normal pool is a session
pool.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>fix_cursorleak</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is a double value that can
be set to make the application leak cursors at a certain
rate. By default, this does not happen, but if set to a
value in the range ]0;1], the value sets the proportion of
cursors that will be leaked. If you want to experiment with
the, start with very low values such as 0.001 and be
prepared that you will receive ORA-01000 errors.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>fix_hardparse</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is a double value that can
be set to make hard parse take place. By default, no hard
parse takes place, but if the parameter is set to a value
higher than zero, hard parse will take place. The valid
range is [0;1].</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>orders_hashcount</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If your database does not have
partitioning, set this to 0, otherwise leave it at the
default. This must be done before you run
<a href="oltpcreate.html">oltpcreate(2rwl)</a>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>runplot_width</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If you are using -g or -G to
show running graphs, they will by default show the latest
60s of activity, unless this parameter is set to a different
value.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>gnuplotjs</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To generate clickable svg
files, your browser must expose a copy of certain javascript
files from your distribution of gnuplot. This parameter sets
the name of the directory where these are stored seen from
the browsers perspective. If you are using gnuplot version
4.6 and have copied the contents of
/usr/share/gnuplot/4.6/js/* to usr/share/gnuplot/4.6/js/
(seen from the root of your http daemon), the value should
be &quot;/usr/share/gnuplot/4.6/js&quot;.</p>

<h2>BURSTS
<a name="BURSTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can include
four different types of &quot;bursts&quot; in your run; one
does a burst using a higher average transaction arrival
rate, the other does a burst using a higher number of worker
threads, the third does an activity burst by changing
(logged on) sessions from being idle to being active, and
the last is an implicit burst being the result of a period
with reduced session pool sizes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the first,
you must provide a factor, by which the arrival rate
increases, and for the second, you must provide the count of
extra worker threads. For both, you provide the time in
seconds from the beginning of the run when the burst should
start and the length of the burst in seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To include a
burst with higher arrival rate, include these
parameters:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>burst_start
<br>
burst_length <br>
burst_factor</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The two first parameters set
the time to start and length of the burst, and the third
parameter is the factor that is applied to the arrival rate
during the burst.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To include a
burst with extra worker threads, include these
parameters:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>wburst_start
<br>
wburst_length <br>
wburst_count</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The two first parameters set
the time to start and length of the burst, and the third
parameter is the number of extra worker threads during the
burst. To prevent all processes from increasing the worker
thread count at the same time, you can include procnumber in
your calculation for wburst_start. As an example, if you set
wburst_start to 200+procnumber, the increase in worker
threads will be at 200s for process 1, 201s for process 2,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All parameters
are double except wburst_count that is an integer, and you
can very well include both types of burst.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The third type
of burst is provided by spedifying a point in time during
the run where the activity changes. All workers are
connected (assuming no pooling is in place), but before that
point in time, only some workers are active. When the point
in time for the change is reached, all workers get active,
which will cause an activity burst, which results in e.g.
many cursors being (soft) parsed at the same time. The four
parameters controlling this are:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>aburst_workers
<br>
aburst_pre_factor <br>
aburst_post_factor <br>
aburst_start</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In the period until
aburst_start, only aburst_workers do actual work while the
remaining (i.e. threadcount-aburst_workers) are connected
but are idle. The arrival rate in the active workers during
this period is a factor aburst_pre_factor higher than
normal. If the value
aburst_pre_factor*aburst_workes/threadcount is 1.0, the
effective arrival rate during this period is the same as it
would have been without an activity burst. In the period
after aburst_start, all workers are active, in the arrival
rate of these is the normal arrival rate multiplied by
aburst_post_factor. The default for both factors is 1.0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The last type
of bursts comes due to a backlog of transactions that are
delayed during a period with reduced sessions in the normal
pool. It only has effect when using session pools.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To include a
temporary delay by reduced session counts, include there
parameters:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>delay_start
<br>
delay_length <br>
delay_min_pool <br>
delay_max_pool</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The two first parameters
(double) set the time to start and the length of the delay,
and the two latter parameter (integer) are the min and max
number of sessions in the normal pool during the delay. If
<b>delay_length</b> is zero, no delay will take place.</p>

<h2>VERIFICATION
<a name="VERIFICATION"></a>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To verify the
directories and files are setup properly, run <b>oltpverify
-d</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To verify the
settings for system users are correct, run <b>oltpverify
-s</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To verify you
can connect to a repository, run <b>oltpverify -r</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To create all
schemas, run <b>oltpcreate</b>; to drop all schemas expect
the repository, run <b>oltpdrop</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To verify
schemas are properly created, run <b>oltpverify -u</b>.</p>

<h2>UNDOCUMENTED PARAMETERS
<a name="UNDOCUMENTED PARAMETERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are some
extra parameters, that you can set in either your
<b>key.rwl</b> file or using -i or -d on the oltprun command
line. To get documentation for these, you need to look at
the parameters.rwl file in the oltp directory.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All oltp
commands accept -H to get help, many also accept --help,
some also -h for that purpose while -h is used to provide
actual argument values for a few commands. For rwloadsim
itself, -h or --help is the option to output help while -H
is used to output help from useroptions. The best way to get
command syntax in a consistent way is to use rwlman; the
second best is to try with a --help option, which works in
all frequently used commands. This is confusing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some oltp
commands accept both single letter and gnu style long
options, which is also confusing.</p>
