<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$directive:value</b></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Directives are
read while scanning the input files to rwloadsim and most
are used to modify the behavior during parsing and code
generation. They are expressly <i>not</i> executed and are
as such not provided to the rwloadsim language parser.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All directives
are initiated by <b>$</b> and a sequence of lower case
letters, and most then have <b>:</b> and another sequence of
non-white-space characters that are the directive value. For
number values, there is no leading sign and only positive
values are accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This page
documents all ordinary directives.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some directives
differ slightly in syntax and are documented in these
separate pages: For conditional compilation using <b>$if
$then $else $endif</b> see <a href="conditional.html">conditional(1rwl)</a>. For include
file processing using <b>$include</b> see <a href="include.html">include(1rwl)</a>. For
option handling see <a href="useroption.html">useroption(1rwl)</a>.</p>

<h2>DIRECTIVES
<a name="DIRECTIVES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$iformat:%&lt;format&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This directive sets the printf
format used whenever an integer is converted to a string;
the default value is &quot;%ld&quot;. Only formats that
actually can be used to convert integers are accepted, and a
warning will be displayed if the conversion isn&rsquo;t
valid for a (small) set of verification values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Some useful
values may be: <b>$iformat:%08ld</b> which makes the string
representation of integers have up to 8 leading zeros. The
directive <b>$iformat:%20ld</b> will cause the string
representation of integers to have 20 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The size of the
internal buffer used to store the string representation of
an integer is at least 30 characters, and rwloadsim ensures
the buffer is not written beyond its size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that in
the following code snippet:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">integer x :=
123; <br>
$iformat:%08ld <br>
printline x;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">the output will
be &rsquo;123&rsquo; and not &rsquo;00000123&rsquo;. The
reason is that the string representation of the integer x is
generated when the value 123 is assigned to it, which is
before the $iformat directive. If you want the directive to
be effective in this case, you need to include it before the
assignment:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$iformat:%08d
<br>
integer x := 123; <br>
printline x;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you need
more advanced output formatting, you should consider using
the printf, fprintf or sprintf statement.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$dformat:%&lt;format&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is similar to $iformat,
except it is used when the string representation of double
variables is needed; similar restrictions apply. The default
dformat is %.2f, and the same minimum 30 characters buffers
is used. As an example use <b>$dformat:%.6f</b> to cause
string representation of doubles to have 6 digits after the
decimal point. As with $iformat, advanced output formatting
is available using printf, fprintf or sprintf.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$randseed:&lt;hexdigits&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The random number generator is
normally provided a seed from /dev/urandom, such that
different executions of rwloadsim generates different random
values. If you want repeatable results, you can use this
directive; the argument is any sequence of hexadecimal
digits (0-9, a-f, A-F); up to twelve of these are used as
the unsigned short entries in the xsubi[] array used by
erand48(3) and nrand48(3). The random numbers in threads
will also be repeatable as they are generated by a
thread-specific permutation of bits in the xsubi[] array.
You can optionally put 0x or 0X in front of the up to twelve
hexadecimal digits.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$startseconds:&lt;double&gt;
<br>
$clockstart:&lt;double&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These directive serves the same
purpose as the <b>-c</b> option and they set the common
start time as a number of seconds after starting rwloadsim.
The directive must be used before the results database is
declared. The two directives have identical behavior; the
reason for having both is that the rwloadsim developer was
using both of the two terms in various circumstances.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$implicit:define
<br>
$implicit:bind <br>
$implicit:both <br>
$implicit:off <br>
$implicit:keepcase <br>
$implicit:lowercase</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These directives control
implicit bind and define, i.e. for rwloadsim to implicitly
match placeholders (bind variables) and select list elements
to declared variables of the same name in your rwl
program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If any of the
first three is in effect when a SQL statement is declared,
that SQL statement will be subject to implicit define, bind
or both, which will take place during the first execute. The
fourth directive turns off both settings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that you
can achieve the same effect for some specific SQL statement
by using either of <b>define sql</b> or <b>bind sql</b> as
part of the declaration of the SQL statement. There is no
semantic difference between the two, using the directive
method is likely to be more appropriate if you want this for
all of your SQL declarations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
rwloadsim converts all letters in the bind variable name or
select list element name to lowercase before matching to a
declared variable. If you do not want that to happen, which
implies you need your rwloadsim variable names to be in
uppercase unless you use quotes in your SQL statement, use
the <b>$implicit:keepcase</b> directive. The default
behavior can be set using <b>$implicit:lowercase</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$bindoutname:on
<br>
$bindoutname:on:identifiersuffix <br>
$bindoutname:off</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These directives control how
implicit bind can be used to also implicitly perform a
bindout.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Normally,
whenever implicit bind is in effect, either through embedded
sql or through an $implicit directive, all binds are
considered input binds, and values from the rwl program are
provided as input to the SQL or PL/SQL text. To use a
bindout where values from SQL (such as the returning clause)
or PL/SQL are being output to your rwl program, you normally
need an explicit bindout.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you use
either of the first two <b>$bindoutname</b> directives, a
bindout will automatically be used whenever the name of the
bind variable (placeholder) in your SQL or PL/SQL text has a
specific suffix. With the first directive, the suffix is the
three letters &rsquo;out&rsquo;, with the second directive,
the suffix is the identifier suffix found after the second
&rsquo;:&rsquo;. In that case, the identifier suffix must
consist of an initial letter, followed by letters, numerals
or underscore.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Lowercase
conversion is controlled via the $lowercase directive as
explained above.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$debugon:&lt;debuglist&gt;
<br>
$debugoff:&lt;debuglist&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The debugon directive has the
same effect as using the <b>-D</b> option to the rwloadsim
executable; debugoff reverses it. The argument is a debug
option (or a comma separated list without spaces); each
option either a hexadecimal value (potentially prefixed by
0x or 0X) or one of the text strings shown at the
<a href="rwloadsim.html">rwloadsim(1rwl)</a> page.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$mute:&lt;integer&gt;
<br>
$alwaysmute:&lt;integer&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These directives will mute the
rwl error with the number provided. The second directive is
useful in the first file and is recognized while scanning
for things like user options, which implies it will take
effect very early during program start. The first directive
can be controlled via <b>$if $then</b> directives; the
second cannot.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$oraerror:stop
<br>
$oraerror:continue</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The first of these tells
rwloadsim to stop as soon as SQL execution gives any ORA-
error. Note that doing so can imply more errors during the
actual program termination. The second tells rwloadsim to
continue when ORA- errors are found during SQL execution.
This is the default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$ora01013:continue
<br>
$ora01013:stop</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Normally, ctrl-c leads to a
controlled stop of the executing rwloadsim process although
the exact details of how clean-up is done cannot by
guaranteed. If you want rwloadsim to continue after
receiving an ORA-01013, use the first directive. The second,
which is the default, undoes this.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$bindoffset:0</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Change bind by position offset
to start at zero; this is primarily useful if you are
running with event 10046 tracing where bind value dumping
starts at #0. With this directive set, the bind position
actually used with the OCIBindByPos call is one larger than
the position set at bind or bindout. The effect of the
directive can be reversed by using <b>$bindoffset:1</b>
which is the default. Note that this directive has no impact
on the numbering of select list elements used with
define.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$maxcode:&lt;integer&gt;
<br>
$maxident:&lt;integer&gt; <br>
$readbuffer:&lt;integer&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These set the maximum size of
the generated p-code, the maximum number of identifiers, or
the size of the buffer used to read lines of text using
<b>readline</b> respectively. They serve the same purpose as
the <b>-I</b>, <b>-C</b> and <b>-B</b> options and can be
used in start-up files or using the <b>$longoption</b>
directive in the first file named with a .rwl suffix.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$statistics:basic
<br>
$statistics:histograms <br>
$statistics:all</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These have the same purpose as
the <b>-s</b>, <b>-ss</b>, and <b>-sss</b> options
respectively. They need to be used before the repository
database is declared.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$setaction:on
<br>
$setaction:reset <br>
$setaction:off</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The $setaction directives
control setting the action (in v$session.action). When on,
the action is set to the procedure name when a database
session is acquired from a pool or a dedicated connection is
being used; the action name is set using the OCI_ATTR_ACTION
attribute of the session and is therefore sent to the
database during the first coming actual round trip. When
reset is specified, the action name is reset when the
session is released or a dedicated connection no longer is
in use; using reset implies an extra otherwise unnecessary
round trip to the database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can get the
same behavior using the <b>-S</b> or <b>-SS</b> option to
rwloadsim.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$oerstatistics:on
<br>
$oerstatistics:off <br>
$oerstatistics:&lt;integer&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These directives controls
saving of ORA- error statistics similar to the
<b>--oer-statistics</b> option. They can be used to turn
saving of error statistics on and off or to set the maximum
number of errors saved (per thread); the default is 50.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$queue:on
<br>
$queue:off</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These have the same effect as
the <b>-Q</b> and <b>-N</b> options; the default is that
queuing simulation using a backlog is off.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$errortime:on
<br>
$errortime:off</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The first of these has the same
effect as the <b>-W</b> option, i.e. to augment all
execution time errors with a time-stamp measured as the
number of seconds since clock start. It is primarily used as
a debugging tool if the exact time of errors is needed. The
second directive turns this off.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$nameexpand:off
<br>
$nameexpand:on</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The former of these has the
same effect as the <b>--no-nameexpand</b> option; the latter
turns file name expansion using environment variable on.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$eventnotify:on
<br>
$eventnotify:off</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The former has the same effect
as the <b>--event-notify</b> option; the latter undoes
<b>--event-notify</b> if found on the command line. These
are only available in the start-up file or via $longoption
directive in the first file named with a .rwl suffix.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$dbfailures:&lt;integer&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If there is a temporary failure
during declaration of a database, rwloadsim will normally
consider the database to be unavailable and not continue
processing. By using this directive, which must be found
before your database declaration, a temporary failure will
cause a re-attempt at creating the database connection. The
integer value of the directive is limit to the number of
connect attempts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Using this
directive will cause session pool databases to have a
minimum size of at least one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The list of
errors that are considered temporary is found in
rwlerror.c.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$embeddedqueryarray:&lt;integer&gt;
<br>
$embeddeddmlarray:&lt;integer&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set a default array size for
respectively queries and dml when using embedded sql.
Without these being set, queries in cursor loops will use
OCI prefetch using memory (currently 100k), and dml will not
use array.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$ampersand:on
<br>
$ampersand:off</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These directives turn ampersand
replacement on and off. When on, directly embedded sql can
be made dynamic by including references to declared string
variables using the syntax <b>&amp;name.</b>. See
<a href="sqlexecution.html">sqlexecution(1rwl)</a> for details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$sessionpool_no_rlb:on
<br>
$sessionpool_no_rlb:off</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These directives control the
mode used to call OCISessionPoolCreate for databases
declared using <b>sessionpool</b>. Be default, the flag
OCI_SPC_NO_RLB is set, to not set this flag, use the second
directive before the database using a session pool is
declared.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$pre31fileassign:on
<br>
$pre31fileassign:warn <br>
$pre31fileassign:off</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These directives control how
file assignment using the <b>:=</b> operator behave. When
the directive is set to <b>on</b>, you can use re-direction
characters such as &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;,
&quot;|&quot; as part of the name of the file causing the
file to be opened for read, append or as a pipeline. When
set to <b>warn</b>, you will get a runtime warning about
such use, and if set to <b>off</b>, no special character
interpretation will take place. In the current release
(3.0.6), the default is <b>warn</b>; it will be set to
<b>off</b> in release 3.1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It is
recommended that you run your rwloadsim code with
<b>warn</b>, e.g. by putting it in your .rwloadsim.rwl file
and use the generated warnings to modify your code to use
the newer file assignment operators.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$niceabort:on
<br>
$niceabort:off</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When the niceabort directive is
turned on, executing an abort statement will produce a short
warning rather than a comprehensive error. The actual effect
of the abort does not change.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$queueeverytiming:on
<br>
$queueeverytiming:off</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, whenever you have a
control loop that include the <b>queue every</b> option, the
time that is registered for waiting for a session and saved
in the wtime column of the runres and persec tables, is the
time actually spent in the OCISessionGet() call. However, as
the <b>queue every</b> option is emulating an actual queue,
the wait time does not include the time for the thread to
wait in the emulated queue. If you use the
<b>$queueeverytiming:on</b> directive, this time is included
in the waiting time. The waiting time therefore more
correctly represent the waiting time that an emulated end
user whould have seen. This is also the case if your
database is dedicated where some execution inside a control
loop starts <i>after</i> the calculated time.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>$musymbol:&lt;text&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When using the <b>m</b> or
<b>M</b> conversion specifier in a printf statement, the
&micro; symbol is by default output as its UTF-8
representation. This directive can be used to set any other
text string, including potentially other characters outside
the ASCII character set. There is no escape processing, so
you must be able to enter the appropriate value using and
editor.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$hostname:&lt;text&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set a value for the hostname
rather than getting it from the Operating System; only
letters a-z or A-Z, numerals, hyphen, period and underscore
are allowed, and the initial character cannot be hyphen or
dot. The hostname is exposed in the variable of the same
name and is being inserted into the rwlrun table when
statistics are gathered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The directive
is only available in a start-up file such as
~/.rwloadsim.rwl.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$sqllogging:stdout
<br>
$sqllogging:stderr <br>
$sqllogging:file:&quot;&lt;text&gt;&quot; <br>
$sqllogging:append:&quot;&lt;text&gt;&quot; <br>
$sqllogging:off</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These directives control
logging of all sql being executed, which in particular can
be useful if you rewrite sqlplus scripts to rwl scripts. The
first two will turn on sql logging to either of stdout or
stderr. The next two will turn on sql logging to the the
file named between the double quotes; the filename can
itself not contain double quote. The two directives open the
file for respectively write (i.e. truncate) or for append.
Expansion of environment variables will take place unless
the $nameexpand:off directive is in effect. The last
directives turns off sql logging.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if
you are running a real simulation, output can be extensive,
and output from multiple threads will be intermixed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$errordetail:on</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This directive has effect if
the client version is 23 or later and it turns on the full
error detail which includes a url to help documentation. In
earlier client versions, the directive is silently
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The directive
is only available in a start-up file such as
~/.rwloadsim.rwl.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$useroption:name
<br>
$userswitch:name <br>
$longoption:option[=value]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Refer to <a href="useroption.html">useroption(1rwl)</a>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$include</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Refer to <a href="include.html">include(1rwl)</a>.</p>
