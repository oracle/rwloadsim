<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the RWP*Load
Simulator a database is a named variable with attributes
telling how the actual database connection is established
and used. An rwloadsim program can and often does have
multiple databases used for different purposes. As an
example, you have a database that uses a session pool to
connect to your database under test as some application
user, another database that uses a dedicated connection as a
user with dba privileges used for queries against v$ views,
and a third database that is your repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You use the
<b>database</b> keyword followed by the name to start a
database declaration. Attributes are typically constants,
mostly strings, but can very well be expressions using
public or private variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All attributes
are optional. If neither username nor password are provided,
external authentication will be used, which typically means
via a wallet. This cannot be done for databases of type
<b>drcp</b> or <b>connectionpool</b>, and for
<b>sessionpool</b> it implies the pool will be
heterogeneous.</p>

<h2>ATTRIBUTES
<a name="ATTRIBUTES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>username</b>
string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies the login name used
to connect to the database. To login as one of sysdba,
sysoper, sysasm, sysbackup, sysdg, syskm, sysrac provide the
username as a string including &quot;as&quot; and the sys
authentication wanted. As an example, the string &quot;admin
as sysdba&quot; will be a sysdba connection using the
username &rsquo;admin&rsquo;. Only dedicated databases can
use such sys authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In stead of
explicit <b>password</b> and <b>connect</b>, the username
can be of the format also used at the command line for the
-l option to rwloadsim, i.e. u/p@c. To use that approach
with external authentication, use the syntax /@c.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you provide
a concatenation immediately after the name of database, that
concatenation is taken as the username; effectively this
implies you can omit the keyword <b>username</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>password</b>
string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies the login password
used to connect to the database. Alternatively, it can be
provided using the u/p@c format for the <b>username</b>. If
not provided, you will be prompted for it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>connect</b>
string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies the connect string
used to connect to the database. Alternatively, it can be
provided as the part after @ using the u/p@c format for the
<b>username</b>. The value is provided directly to e.g. the
OCIServerAttach call and can therefore be of any format
accepted such as short form URL style,
&quot;//host/service&quot; or the name of an entry in the
tnsnames.ora file. If not provided, the empty string is
assumed, which will imply connection via either the TWO_TASK
or the ORACLE_SID environment variable. For all practical
purposes, this is similar to how sqlplus does it.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>default</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Make this the database used by
default when no atclause is used. It is recommended that you
only use this in simple cases where only one database is in
use; if multiple databases are needed, you are advised
always to explicitly choose them using an atclause.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>results</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Marks this database as the
database used for the rwloadsim repository.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>drcp</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use pooling against a DRCP or
PRCP database using OCISessionPool. Note that rwloadsim does
not verify that you actually use a connect string including
either <b>:pooled</b> in URL style or
<b>(server=pooled)</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>reconnect</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Only connect when an actual
database session is required by your rwloadsim program. Note
that this can imply a high number of database connections
and dis-connections.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>dedicated</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>threads
dedicated</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use dedicated connections that
are established once and kept logged on during the complete
execution. Each thread will get their own such a database
connection. If using the second syntax, the main thread will
use the <b>reconnect</b> method.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cursorcache</b>
value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the value of the
OCI_ATTR_STMTCACHESIZE; the default is 20.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>sessionpool</b>
value <b><br>
sessionpool</b> value <b>..</b> value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create a session pool, from
which a session will be used when a procedure containing sql
is being called. In the former case, the pool will have a
fixed size, in the latter case, the size will be variable
between the two values provided. OCISessionPool is used to
implement this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
is the typical pooling method used by many popular
application programming interface such as UCP for Java.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>connectionpool</b>
value <b><br>
connectionpool</b> lo <b>..</b> hi</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create a connectionpool pool,
that can subsequently be used as the connection for
dedicated, threads dedicated or reconnect database. In
itself, a connection pool cannot be used to execute any sql
or database statements as it has no session associated with
it; a session only gets created when the connection pool is
used by an actual database. The pool itself can have a size
or a range of sizes, and it is implemented using
OCIConnectionPool.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that many
popular application programming interface such as UCP for
Java does not have the counterpart of an
OCIConnectionPool.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>release</b>
value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For a pool, set the timeout
value for idle sessions (OCI_ATTR_SPOOL_TIMEOUT) or
connections (OCI_ATTR_CONN_TIMEOUT); the default is 60s.
Sessions or connections in the pool that have been idle for
more than the release value will disconnect unless the pool
already has its minimum size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>wait</b>
value <b><br>
wait</b> value <b>then break <br>
wait</b> value <b>then</b> identifier<b>(</b> ...
<b>)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, whenever a worker
threads gets a session from a session pool, it will wait
until an entry is available. If you provide <b>wait</b> and
a value (in seconds), the worker thread will only wait for
the specified time. If no <b>then</b> option is specified,
either of ORA-24457 or ORA-24459 is returned, but rwloadsim
will attempt continuing (as is the case after any oracle
error), most likely causing further subsequent errors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If <b>then
break</b> is specified, the procedure that was causing the
session get will not be executed; as this is typically done
inside a control loop, the control loop will handle what to
do next.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, if
<b>then</b> and a procedure call with a potentially empty
argument list is specified, that procedure will be executed
in stead of the procedure that was causing the session get.
The procedure called like this <i>cannot</i> perform any
database calls (as it is called exactly when a session was
unavailable), but it can have the <b>statisticsonly</b>
attribute causing the count of failures in getting a session
to be maintained in the repository. As for <b>then
break</b>, a control loop will typically control what to do
next.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>oraerror</b> variable will contain either of the values
24457 or 24459, which you can use in the procedure to e.g.
print a message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>connect
connectionpool</b> identifier</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When creating a dedicated,
threads dedicated or reconnect database, rather than using
an ordinary connect string, use the named connection
pool.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>connectionclass</b>
string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For drcp and sessionpool this
option specifies the required connection class that will be
set using OCI_ATTR_CONNECTION_CLASS. If none is provided a
default of &quot;rwloadsim&quot; will be used.</p>

<h2>USAGE
<a name="USAGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Dedicated
database do not include session pooling and the connection
will be established when the database is declared or when a
thread is started. The database connection will be held
until end of the program or thread.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a (threads)
dedicated database has been given the <b>requestmark</b>
attribute, OCIRequestBegin() and OCIRequestEnd() will be
called at the beginning and end of the first procedure
containing SQL (or having explicit statistics). This can be
used to test Application Continuity when a session pool is
not in use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a (threads)
dedicated database has been given the <b>statemark</b>
attribute, the state of the session will change to
OCI_SESSION_STATEFUL respectively OCI_SESSION_STATELESS at
the beginning and end of the first procedure containing SQL
(or having explicit statistics). This can improve session
sharing with DRCP and PRCP.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both features,
requestmark and statemark, are to be considered experimental
and may change in a future release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For databases
that include some type of pooling (sessionpool, reconnect or
drcp), session acquire and release takes place at the
beginning and end of the first procedure containing SQL, or
the first procedure with an explicit statistics
attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have a
default database declared as anything but dedicated, you
need to wrap transactions in your main program with
<b>execute</b> and <b>end</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The RWP*Load
Simulator uses several methods to prevent database
connection storms from happening. A connection storm is
characterized by an attempt to create many database
connections almost simultaneously. If you are using variable
sized session pools, are using the reconnect method or
extensively use <b>release database,</b> the risk of running
into connection storms will be considerably higher than with
any other connection methods.</p>

<h2>FAILURES
<a name="FAILURES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If using or
establishing a database connection fails with an error that
is considered to be of &quot;temporary&quot; or
&quot;recoverable&quot; nature, rwloadsim will attempt
making the connection again. A few examples of such errors
are ORA-00018, &quot;maximum number of sessions
exceeded&quot; and ORA-03114 &quot;not connected to
ORACLE&quot;. The attempt at (re-)establishing the
connection will be delayed by some seconds including a
random part in order to prevent connection storms. Note that
it is not guaranteed that a connection can be established.
The full list of these errors is available in the routine
rwldberror3 found in rwlerror.c.</p>
