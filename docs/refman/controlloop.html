<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The control
loop is the primary mechanism to drive repeated execution in
RWP*Load Simulator, i.e. to simulate actual workload. The
control of the loop includes time to start and stop, number
of executions and wait time between each execution or
frequency of execution. Either <b>stop</b> or <b>count</b>
must be provided, the rest are optional.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In rwloadsim,
time is <i>always</i> measured in seconds and on most
Operating System, the resolution is 1ms or better. You
should always use variables or expressions of type double to
represent time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All control
loops (in all threads) have their timings coordinated at
(approximately) the same time, and unless the start time is
explicitly set to non-zero, this means starting at the same
time. The actual time with reference to this common start
time is returned by the predefined variable runseconds. In
order to ensure reasonable ramp-up to e.g. start database
connections in session pools, or to actually start operating
system threads, rwloadsim has a built-in delay from the
clock time it is called until this 0s time when control
loops really start processing; the default is 5s. If you use
the value of runseconds before this common control loop
start time, it will have a negative value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
requirement to use a control loop, but if you do not,
execution in threads will start as soon as the thread is
created. To execute something just once at a controlled
time, you therefore need to use a control loop with count
set to one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Multiple
control loops can very well be executed (by the same thread)
after each other, but they cannot be nested, neither
directly nor indirectly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a pooled
database is in use, a session will be acquired from the pool
before each execute of a procedure (or function) doing
database work, and it will be returned to the pool when the
procedure (or function) exits. Control loops are normally
part of a thread execution, but can also be declared and
used outside.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The control
loop is controlled via one or more options that appear in
any sequence after the initial <b>for</b> keyword. The list
of options is terminated by the <b>loop</b> keyword and then
followed by the statement list to be executed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The available
options are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>start
t</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Start execution at the
time-stamp provided by the double expression, t. The default
is 0s and negative values are allowed in which case the
thread will start before the normal thread start time as
explained above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>stop
t</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Stop execution at the
time-stamp, t, which is a double; an exact stop time cannot
be guaranteed. Either count or stop must be provided. Note
that the stop time is calculated when the loop starts and
not recalculated during loop execution. You can use the
<b>break</b> statement to finish a control loop before the
stop time expires.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>count
t</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Execute the loop after t
executions; only the integer part of the expression, t, is
used. Either count or stop must be provided.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>wait
t</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Wait after each execution by a
time provided as the double expression t. The expression is
(as opposed to the stop time) calculated after each loop so
a random wait time can be provided as e.g.
<b>uniform(0.5,1.5)</b> which would mean a random wait time
between 0.5s and 1.5s. You cannot specify both <b>wait</b>
and <b>every</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">[ <b>queue</b>
] <b>every e</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Attempt execution every so
often where the double expression, e, is the time in
seconds. This is different from a wait time, as <b>every</b>
sets the time between each start of the execution, so
<b>every</b> simulates an expected arrival rate in a queuing
system. Before an execution, the point in time to start the
next execution will be calculated, either relatively to
start time of the current loop or relatively to the original
common start time; the latter implements a backlog and is
achieved using the <b>queue</b> keyword. If a planned start
time is surpassed, the execution will start immediately. To
simulate queuing systems, use <b>queue every</b> with an
argument of <b>erlang2(1/x)</b>, where x is the expected
arrival rate per second.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The keyword can
be prefixed with either &quot;queue&quot; or
&quot;noqueue&quot; which will enable or disable queuing
simulation using a backlog. Either of these overwrites the
setting done via the -Q or -N options to rwloadsim or set
via the $queue directive.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLE
<a name="EXAMPLE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This first
example shows a very typical actual simulation of a
workload.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">for queue every erlang2(0.1) stop 300 loop
  doit() at mydb;
end loop;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Execute the
procedure doit() repeatedly at random times on average once
every 0.1s for a period of 5 minutes. If the doit()
procedures does database work and the mydb database is using
a session pool or drcp, a session will be acquired at the
beginning and released at the end of each call of the
procedure. If the normal execution time for the call to
doit() - including time to potentially wait for a database
session - is much less than 0.1s, there will normally be
actual idle time between each execution. Conversely, if the
execution time of doit() is larger than 0.1s, it is possible
that there will be no idle time between each execution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The use of
Erlang distribution with k=2 is very common when simulating
queuing behavior. See
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This second
example shows how the control loop can be used to execute a
procedure at regular intervals.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">integer x := 0;
for start 10 every 10 stop 120 loop
  save_data(x, runseconds);
  x += 1;
end loop;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Starting 10s
after the common start time and subsequently every 10s call
the procedure save_data() with two parameters, the last of
which will be the time in seconds from the common start
time. Due to the omission of the <b>queue</b> keyword, if
any call to save_data() takes longer than 10s, all
subsequent calls will be delayed although still 10s between
each.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This third
example shows how a procedure marked with the statisticsonly
attribute can be used to count failures when simulating a
real queuing system with a time out.</p>
<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">procedure doit_failed() statisticsonly
  # do nothing except counting executions
  null;
end;


for queue every erlang2(0.1) stop 300 loop
  if runseconds() &gt; everyuntil+1.0 then
    # if we are more than 1 second late, this is a failure
    doit_failed();
  else
    # only do the actual work when there is no time out
    doit() at mydb;
  end if;
end loop;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
doit_failed() procedure will not attempt getting a database
session and will not actually do any work, so when the time
out happens (current time more than one second after the
expected start time), rather than calling the real
procedure, which would both need to get a database session
and to execute some actual SQL, a simple count of the time
outs will happen.</p>
