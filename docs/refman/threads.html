<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">threadexecution
&minus; RWP*Load Simulator start and control threads</p>

<h2>SYNTAX
<a name="SYNTAX"></a>
</h2>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">threadexecution ::=
<b>run
</b>  thread<b> ;</b> { thread<b> ;</b> }
<b>end</b> [<b> run</b> ]


thread ::=
<b>threads</b> expression [ atclause ]
  statementlist
<b>end</b> [<b> threads</b>  ]</pre>


<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>run</b>
keyword initiating thread execution is the primary means in
the RWP*Load Simulator to simulate actual workload, which it
does by starting threads and waiting for these to complete.
Threads are grouped, and all threads in each group execute
the same.</p>

<h2>USAGE
<a name="USAGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each group of
threads consists of a specified number of threads that
execute the same list of statements; the number of threads
(which must be zero or larger) is provided as the expression
after the <b>threads</b> keyword. Similarly to the
<b>execute</b> statement, you can optionally provide an at
clause to specify a database that the threads will use while
executing the list of statements.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The threads
will be started using the threading interface of Oracle Call
Interface and the threads will start executing immediately
and will finish when the last statement in the list
finishes. To have threads start actual work at a known time,
you must use the control loop with some <b>start</b> time.
You must similarly use a control loop if you want threads to
run for some period of time using the <b>stop</b> option in
the control loop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Variables
except those with the <b>threads sum</b> attribute and files
open for reading will initially have their values from the
main program. At thread start <b>threads sum</b> variables
will have the value zero and the value will be added to the
value in main when threads complete. Files open for reading
will be closed in threads.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is common
that different threads should execute different workloads,
which can be achieved in two different ways:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the work to
be performed has a different nature, say some threads
execute business logic while others execute dba work, you
start these as different groups of threads i.e. using
multiple <b>threads ... end</b> keywords. You would often
also use different at clauses for these.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want
your threads to emulate different types of business logic
that each is implemented in some procedure, use a single
thread group - possibly with many threads - that all execute
some random procedure.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLE
<a name="EXAMPLE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
example shows a total of 11 threads being started.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first ten
will start at the common start time and 10 times per second
(i.e. with a random arrival rate of 0.1s between each)
randomly execute one the three types of business logic.
Assuming each of the three business logic procedures include
some sql processing, and assuming the database named mydb
uses a session pool, a database session will be acquired and
released at the begin and end of each procedure call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The last thread
will call the procedure syswork() every 10s.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All threads
will run for 300 seconds.</p>
<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">procedure abc() ... end;
procedure def() ... end;
procedure xyz() ... end;

random procedure array doit (abc 5, def 70, xyz 25);

procedure syswork() ... end;


run
  threads 10 at mydb
    for queue every erlang2(1/10) stop 300 loop
      doit();
    end;
  end;
  threads 1 at systemdb
    for start 10 every 10 stop 300 loop
      syswork();
    end loop;
  end threads;
end;</pre>


<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It could very
well be considered a bug, that a thread execution is not a
statement and therefore cannot be done inside a procedure or
inside any compound statement; it is only available as part
of your main code similar to complex declarations. Fixing
this will, however, be very complex and the restriction is
unlikely to be lifted.</p>
