SCANNING.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In rwloadsim,
you can include SQL statements in three different ways:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The most simple
method, called <b>embedded sql</b> can be used if you need
to execute single row SQL, typically dml, ddl or single row
queries, or if you need to execute some query as a cursor
loop. You simply include the SQL text directly in your rwl
program. The following constraints apply to embedded
sql:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>1.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p><i>All</i> bind variables must exist as variables of the
same name, and bindout will be done only if the
<b>$bindoutname:on</b> directive is in effect.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>2.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>For both single row queries and cursor loop, <i>all</i>
select list elements must have simple names or have an alias
as a simple name, and these must exist as variables.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>3.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>No specifications such as array size can be provided;
however, see below for directives setting array sizes for
embedded sql.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>4.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>The sql is anonymous and cannot be used with any
<b>modify sql</b> statement as these require the name of the
sql.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second
approach is called <b>immediate sql</b> which is still
anonymous but without the first three restrictions of
embedded sql. In your code, you initiate immediate sql with
the keywords <b>sql execute</b> and it is finished with the
keyword <b>end</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The third
method was the only one available in earlier versions of
rwloadsim. Using this method, you first declare the sql
statement as a variable, which subsequently can be used in
several different places. The typical use of a SQL variable
is to execute it as such, which normally is done for DML,
DDL, PL/SQL or single row queries, or if it is a query
without a known number of rows to execute it in a cursor
loop. Using a variable is suggested if you need to execute
the same SQL from different places in your rwloadsim
program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>sql</b>
keyword followed by an identifier initiates a declaration of
a static or dynamic sql statement and the declaration
potentially provides a list of variables used for bind,
define and bindout in addition to several other attributes.
Each such attribute (such as bind) must be terminated by a
;. and the complete declaration must be finished by the
keyword <b>end</b> which can be optionally followed by
<b>sql</b> or by the name of the sql.</p>

<h2>SCANNING FOR SQL OR PL/SQL
<a name="SCANNING FOR SQL OR PL/SQL"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The RWP*Load
Simulator recognizes keywords or sequences of multiltiple
keywords that initiate SQL or PL/SQL and if these are seen,
SQL or PL/SQL scan will be started. As opposed to anything
else in rwloadsim, this scan is not case sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
list all keywords or sequences of keywords that initiate
scan for PL/SQL, which implies the scan finishes by a line
with white space and a / or . at the end of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>declare <br>
begin <br>
-- <br>
create</b> [ <b>or replace</b> ] <b>procedure <br>
create</b> [ <b>or replace</b> ] <b>function <br>
create</b> [ <b>or replace</b> ] <b>package <br>
create</b> [ <b>or replace</b> ] <b>library <br>
create</b> [ <b>or replace</b> ] <b>trigger <br>
create</b> [ <b>or replace</b> ] <b>java</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
lists all keywords or sequences of keywords that initiate
scan for SQL, which implies the scan additionally finishes
by a ; at the end of a line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>select <br>
delete <br>
update <br>
insert <br>
create</b> (except those mentioned above) <b><br>
drop <br>
alter <br>
/* <br>
administer key management <br>
analyze <br>
associate statistics <br>
audit <br>
comment on <br>
disassociate statistics <br>
explain plan <br>
flashback database <br>
flashback table <br>
grant <br>
lock table <br>
noaudit <br>
purge <br>
rename <br>
revoke <br>
savepoint <br>
set transaction <br>
set constraint <br>
set role <br>
with</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The two comment
keywords <b>/*</b> and <b>--</b> will initiate scanning for
respectively SQL or PL/SQL even if they are not immediatedly
followed by white space.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As opposed to
SQL*Plus, rwloadsim does not terminate scanning for SQL or
PL/SQL at an empty line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Rwloadsim does
not make any modifications to either, so the complete text
including any newline, white space, etc from the initial
keyword and until the terminator becomes the text that
eventually will be the argument to OCIStmtPrepare2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have a
need for comments inside the SQL or PL/SQL, use the
appropriate syntax from those languages, i.e. -- or /* */; a
# will be part of the SQL or PL/SQL text.</p>

<h2>STATIC SQL
<a name="STATIC SQL"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You declare a
static sql variable using the keyword <b>sql</b> followed by
the name of the variable, and the actual text of the SQL or
PL/SQL must follow. There are three ways to provide the SQL
text:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Have rwloadsim scan for SQL or
PL/SQL similar to how SQL*Plus does it. This is the
preferred approach.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>2.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Provide the SQL or PL/SQL text in a named file. As an
alternative to embed your SQL or PL/SQL text directly in
your rwl source file you can use the <b>file</b> keyword
followed by a concatenation that resolves to a file name.
The file will be opened and the SQL or PL/SQL text will be
read from it; the file should not have either of the
terminators ; . /.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>3.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Have a concatenation (including just a string constant)
that is the full sql text. This is primarily useful if the
full SQL or PL/SQL text is created from concatenating
several text strings or variables containing text strings.
Note that local variables cannot be used for this, and that
the value is a static, compile time value. If you need sql
inside a procedure that contains values from expressions,
use the dynamic sql approach of rwloadsim. Also note that if
you use this approach, any &quot; needed in your sql text
must be prefixed by \ for it to become part of a string in
rwloadsim.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<h2>DYNAMIC SQL
<a name="DYNAMIC SQL"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If there is no
SQL or PL/SQL provided, neither directly in your rwl source
file nor being read from a file, the declared sql statement
is dynamic and the text must be provided using the <b>modify
sql</b> command. Note that the rwl language (presently) does
not have a mechanism to <i>describe</i> the actually
provided SQL statement. You can neither get the type of the
sql (e.g. query or DML), nor the list of select list
elements or bind variables. During declaration of a dynamic
sql, you can provide bind, bindout or define variables that
are known to be present for all executions regardless of the
actual SQL text. During later execution, you can add extra
variables as needed using the <b>modify sql</b> command.</p>

<h2>ATTRIBUTES
<a name="ATTRIBUTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In most cases,
you will need to provide attributes for your sql statement.
These include variables use for bind and/or define, array
sizes, use of the cursor cache, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>bind
placeholder variable</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Bind the named variable as
input to a placeholder in your sql text. The placeholder is
either an integer which results in bind-by-position or is a
text string which results in bind-by-name in which case the
first character of the text must be a colon. This can e.g.
be used in the values clause of an insert statement, or in
the where clause of a query.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can replace
the placeholder by a single <b>:</b> in which case it will
be bind-by-name where both the name of the placeholder and
the name of the variable it is bound to is the identifier
following the colon.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>bindout
placeholder variable</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Bind the named variable as
output from a placeholder in your sql text. This can e.g. be
used as an output variable in a PL/SQL block or in the
returning clause of an insert statement. Bindout cannot be
used in combination with the array interface. As for normal
bind, you can use bind-by-position or bind-by-name and you
can replace the placeholder with <b>:</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>define
position variable</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Define the named variable as
select-list-element of a query. The integer position is the
number in the select list, and the call results in a
define-by-position.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>bind sql
<br>
define sql</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These options will turn on
implicit bind respectively define for the SQL statement;
both can be used as needed. See below under IMPLICIT
BIND/DEFINE for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>array
size</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the number of rows in the
array interface. For cursor loops, the default is to use an
array sized by memory, and for anything else, the default is
1. For cursor loops, the array interface is handled using
the features of Oracle Call Interface, unless you use the
<b>array define</b> keywords in which case the array is
allocated by rwloadsim. For DML, the array interface is
allocated by rwloadsim and is automatically flushed as
needed during commit or rollback. You can flush the array
for DML explicitly using a <b>modify sql array execute</b>
statement.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ignoreerror</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Ignore any error during
execution of the sql statement. You should code error
handling yourself using the <b>oraerror</b> and/or
<b>oraerrortext</b> variables.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>nocursorcache</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, rwloadsim will use
the cursor cache provided by Oracle Call Interface. It may
be beneficial to turn this off for sql that is only executed
once.</p>

<h2>IMPLICIT BIND/DEFINE
<a name="IMPLICIT BIND/DEFINE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Typically, you
will use <b>bind</b> and/or <b>define</b> to associate
variables in your rwl program with bind-variables (a.k.a.
placeholders) or select list elements. To ease your rwl
program writing, you can have rwloadsim do this implicitly,
which it does by matching names of placeholders or select
list elements in your SQL statement to declared variables in
your rwl program. If a match is found, the mapping will be
done and the appropriate bind or define is handled without
an explicit <b>bind</b> and/or <b>define</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This implicit
matching can be specified as part of your SQL statement
declaration or it can be enabled generally via directives.
The implicit matching takes place once during the first
execution of your SQL statement, and the binds and/or
defines done will subsequently be used for any subsequent
execution. The name of the select list element or bind
variable found in the SQL statement will be converted to
lowercase before matching to a variable name. This mechanism
can be turned off using the <b>$implicit:keepcase</b>
directive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If your SQL
statement has bind variables (e.g. :1, :2, etc) or select
list elements (e.g. expressions), that cannot possibly be
matched to any identifiers, you need to either use explicit
bind or define or to replace a bind variable by a proper
name or give an alias to the select list element.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any bindout
required will be done if the <b>$bindoutname:on</b>
directive is in effect, otherwise it must be explicitly
done. Implicit define cannot be used in combination with
array define.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can combine
explicit and implicit bind/define, in which case the
implicit behavior will only apply to those not already done
explicitly. It is, however, suggested you do not combine the
two.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Queries with
implicit define and without an explicit <b>array</b> will
use OCI prefetch based on memory set to 100kB.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
use implicit bind/define with dynamic SQL, in which case any
implicitly created binds and/or defines are released when
<b>modify sql release</b> is being performed.</p>

<h2>IMMEDIATE SQL
<a name="IMMEDIATE SQL"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In version 3 of
rwloadsim, you can use the keyword <b>execute</b> rather
than an identifier, causing your SQL to be unnamed and
immediately executed. This simplifies your rwloadsim code as
you do not need to separate the declaration and the
execution of your SQL statements. Additionally, implicit
bind and define will be enabled by default for immediate
sql.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The immediate
sql syntax can be used stand alone to execute single row
queries, DDL, DML or PL/SQL, or it can be used as part of a
cursor loop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If bindout is
needed, you can use the <b>$bindoutname:on</b> directive,
which causes rwloadsim to inspect the first characters of
the placeholder, and if these match, the bind will be a
bindout. The only specification you typically would need is
<b>array</b> to enable the array interface for DML. This
cannot be used if bindout is in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The sql text
for immediate sql can be a concatenation, which is
calculated at runtime, effectively implying dynamically
generated sql. However, as rwloadsim does not have a
possibility for the programmer to <i>describe</i> the sql to
find select list elements and/or bind variables, these must
be &quot;known&quot; to the programmer. As an example, using
&rsquo;select *&rsquo; in a query requires the programmer to
know what the asterisk expands to and therefore which define
variables to declare.</p>

<h2>EMBEDDED SQL
<a name="EMBEDDED SQL"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Version 3 of
rwloadsim also has the possibility to simply embed static
sql directly without the need for the <b>sql</b> and
<b>end</b> keywords to wrap the sql and any specifications
needed. Due to the missing keywords, you cannot provide any
specifications, which also means you cannot set the array
size. You can set a default array sizes using either of the
directives <b>$embeddedqueryarray</b> or
<b>$embeddeddmlarray</b>. The default for queries in cursor
loops is to use OCI memory based array and for dml to not
use array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
<b>$bindoutname:on</b> directive is in effect, placeholder
names where the first characters match the letters of the
directive will be used as bindout.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Simple

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Declare some

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is a
programming error not to use <b>bindout</b> when needed, and
not doing so can lead to unexpected results. In this
code</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">integer val :=
10; <br>
begin <br>
:val := 42; <br>
end; <br>
/ <br>
printline val, 0+val;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">the output from
the printline statement will be</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">10 42</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">since the
string representation of val is set to the string
&quot;10&quot; during the initial assignement, while the
implicit bind will be to the integer representation. The
latter is then used in the expression 0+val. If the correct
bindout had been provided, the string representation
(&quot;42&quot;) of val would have been generated after
execution of the PL/SQL block.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The scan for
SQL or PL/SQL starts anywhere one of the keywords listed
above are found. If this is used at an inappropriate place,
the rwloadsim parser will report an error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Previous
versions of rwloadsim did <i>not</i> recognize all SQL
keywords or sets of keywords and you could therefore use
these as identifiers. As SQL scan now is initiated by
<i>any</i> possible keyword, you will get errors if you have
been using these as identifiers and you will need to change
your code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
full syntax for <b>create java</b> is more complex than
rwloadsim recognizes and that you therefore will need to
initiate <b>create java</b> by <b>--</b> if it includes any
of the keywords <b>and resolve</b>, <b>and compile</b> or
<b>noforce</b>.</p>
