RWP*Load Simulator execution statistics</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An important
feature of the RWP*Load Simulator is to save execution
statistics and make these available for later processing,
graphing, reporting, etc. To do this, a repository database
is required that typically is different from the database
under test. In your rwloadsim program, procedures executing
sql are the items on which various times are measured and
saved. Through options to rwloadsim, you can decide how much
statistics will be saved.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The actual save
of statistics to the repository database takes place just
before termination of rwloadsim, except when using the
--flush-every option.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Consider the
example shown at <a href="threadexecution.html">threadexecution(1rwl)</a> where three
procedures named abc, def, and xyz, are declared. Each of
them is assumed to implement some business logic that is
being simulated. When one of these procedures execute
against a database using a session pool, these steps are
involved:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">get session
from pool</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">execute
business logic</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">release session
back to pool</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When simple
statistics (using <b>-s</b> or <b>--statistics</b> option to
rwloadsim), the times taken to get the session and to
execute the business logic are measured and the sum from all
executions of these two measurements together with an
execute count are saved in the repository database together
with the name of the procedure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The total time
to get the session from the pool and to execute the business
logic would be the time perceived by an end-user who cannot
distinguish between the two. If you are using <b>-ss</b> or
<b>--histograms</b> rwloadsim will additionally save
histograms of this total time. After each execution, the
total time is grouped into a bucket that is a factor two
wide, so buckets may be intervals like [1ms;2ms], [2ms;4ms],
[4ms;8ms], etc and the count of executions in each bucket
together with the total time for that bucket is saved in the
repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By using
<b>-sss</b> or <b>--persecond</b> rwloadsim will
additionally keep track of the number of executions of each
procedure per second through the whole run.</p>

<h2>USAGE
<a name="USAGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
save any statistics, you need to have a database declared
with the <b>results</b> attribute. For each execution of
rwloadsim with a results database and with one of the
statistics options, a sequence number is retrieved from the
results database. This sequence number is saved in various
tables in the RUNNUMBER column and it is available in your
rwloadsim program in the variable runnumber.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In
multi-process runs, a number of rwloadsim processes are
using the same number; however each process is saving its
own statistics values to the repository tables. Therefore,
all such tables have a column named PROCNO, which is the
Operating System process number unless provided by a <b>-p
procno</b> option to rwloadsim.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To get
aggregated results for all processes in one multi-process
run, there are additional views in the repository database;
these are roughly the same as their underlying tables but
have a PCOUNT column in stead of the PROCNO column.</p>

<h2>TABLES
<a name="TABLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The repository
contains the following tables:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rwlrun</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Stores information about each
run such as its runnumber, a key and a comment provided as
options to rwloadsim, common start time, etc.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>runres</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Saves statistics from the
<b>-s</b> option including procedure name, total time spent
getting a session and total time executing.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>histogram</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Saves statistics from the
<b>-ss</b> option including procedure name, bucket interval,
count and total time in each bucket.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>persec</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Saves statistics from the
<b>-sss</b> option including procedure name, second after
the common start time and count of executions in that
second.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>oerstats</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Saves statistics from the
<b>-r</b> option, which effectively is a log of all ORA-
errors received. Note that the default behavior of rwloadsim
after receiving an ORA- error is to continue unless you have
used the $oraerror:stop directive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rwlcpu,
sysres</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These tables are not used by
rwloadsim but are created in the repository. There are used
by several demonstration workloads.</p>

<h2>VIEWS
<a name="VIEWS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
tables, the repository has views. For the three primary
tables, runres, histogram, persec and for the auxiliary
table rwlcpu views named <b>runres_a</b>,
<b>histogram_a</b>, <b>persec_a</b>, <b>rwlcpu_a</b>,
perform aggregation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
additional views exist:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>percentiles</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For each run and procedure, the
view shows average and 50%, 90%, etc. percentiles of the
user perceived execution times; i.e. the sum of the time to
get a session and to execute the actual code.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>fractiles</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For each run and procedure, the
view shows the histogram information and additionally show
the percentage of all executions that is at least as fast as
the upper limit in each histogram bucket.</p>

<h2>DATES
<a name="DATES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>rwlrun</b> table has a column, rdate, that stores the
common start time for control loops, which is the time
rwloadsim (the prepare step in case of multi-process) was
started plus the value of the --startseconds option. The
column is of type DATE, and the value for this date is
always in UTC timezone irrespective of your settings for
environment variables that control timezone settings.</p>
