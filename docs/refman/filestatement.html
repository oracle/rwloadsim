<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">File in
rwloadsim is implemented using FILE * from the standard I/O
library in C. A file is declared like other simple types and
can be declared publicly, privately or locally, but
<i>cannot</i> be used as an argument to procedures or
functions. Files are treated line-oriented although they are
fully buffered by the standard I/O library. Files can be
opened for reading and writing similar to how the fopen(3)
call does it and can be used as pipe-lines similar to how
popen(3) does it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To open a file,
assign an expression containing a string to the variable,
and to close a file, assign <b>null</b> to it.</p>

<h2>USAGE
<a name="USAGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To open a file,
use one of the assignment syntaxes where the variable v must
be a file, and the concatenation is taken as the name of the
file or a pipeline to be executed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">v <b>:=</b> e
<br>
v <b>&gt;=</b> e</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Open a file for writing. The
first operator, which will be deprecated and eventually
desupported, is kept for legacy reasons, and it is suggested
that new code uses the second.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">v
<b>&gt;&gt;=</b> e</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Open the file for appending,
i.e. write at the end of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">v <b>&lt;=</b>
e</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Open a file for reading.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">v <b>&gt;|=</b>
e</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Open a pipeline for writing;
the concatenation will be given to the popen() call with a
second argument of &quot;w&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">v <b>&lt;|=</b>
e</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Open a pipeline for reading;
the concatenation will be given to the popen() call with a
second argument of &quot;r&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">v <b>:=
null</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Close a file or pipeline.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the cases
where an ordinary file (and not a pipe-line) is opened,
environment expansion of $NAME or ${NAME} is done similar to
how it is done in the shell, unless the
<b>--no-nameexpand</b> option or the <b>$namexpand:off</b>
directive is in effect. You can also use $n where n is a
single digit between 1 and 9 to expand the value of a
positional argument to rwloadsim. This is not done for
pipelines, although the popen call is likely to do it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
concatenation is <b>null</b> the file will be closed or the
pipe-line terminated. You can use any of the assign
operators to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>write</b> v,
e1 [, e2, ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>print</b> e1
[, e2, ... ]</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>writeline</b>
v [, e1 ... ]</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>printline</b>
[e1 ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Write the concatenations e1,
e2, etc to the named file with a single space character
between each. The <b>writeline</b> statement (that does not
require any actual concatenation arguments) will
additionally write a new-line. The <b>print</b> and
<b>printline</b> perform the same although writing to
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>fflush</b>
v</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Flush the file identified by
the variable v; this effectively calls fflush(3).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>readline</b>
v,s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The identifier v must be a
file, and the identifier s must be a string. The statement
reads one line from the file up to and including the newline
character and assigns the line except the terminating
newline character to the string s.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>readline</b>
v<b>,</b> i1<b>,</b> i2<b>,</b> ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The identifier v must be a file
from which a line is read. The line is split into
white-space separated tokens that are assigned to the
variable i1, i2, etc. If fewer tokens than variables are
found, the last will be assigned <b>null</b> even if they
are of type string. If there are too few variables to
receive all tokens, the last variable will have the
remaining part of the line assigned to it. In all cases, if
the variables are not of type string, the usual implicit
conversion to either integer or double will take place.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>for
readline</b> v<b>,</b> i1<b>,</b> i2 <b>and</b> e
<b>loop</b> s;s;s; <b>end</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The readloop reads <i>lines</i>
from a file and writes them into variables. The first
identifier, v, must be a variable of type file that is open
for read. The semantics of the readline loop is somewhat
similar to the semantics of doing something like <b>while
read ... ; do</b> in the shell. If there is only one
variable, i1, in addition to the file variable, that
variable must be of type string and the full line read from
the file (excluding the terminating newline) will be saved
in that variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If there are
multiple variables, i1, i2, ... they can be of type integer,
double or string. In that case, it is assumed that each line
of the file contains white-space separated tokens. The first
of these will be saved in the first variable, i1, the second
in the second variable, i2, etc. If there are more tokens in
the line read from the file than there are variables to save
those into, the last variable will contain the remaining
part of the line. If there are fewer tokens in the line read
from the file than there are variables, the last ones will
be <b>null</b>, even if they are of type string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you need
more complex processing of input lines, use the first form
with only one string variable to contain the whole line,
which you subsequently process using <b>regex</b> or
<b>regexextract</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When
end-of-file is reached, the loop terminates; you still need
to explicitly close the file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The optional
<b>and</b> expression before the <b>loop</b> keyword, causes
reading to stop when the expression, e, is zero; You can
similarly use a <b>break</b> statement. In either case, you
can continue reading from the file.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can operate
on stdin, stdout or stderr by using the predefined variables
named <b>stdin</b>, <b>stdout</b> or <b>stderr</b>
respectively. Do not close these.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, it
is an error not to close files or pipe-lines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Files and
pipe-lines can very well be opened, operated upon and closed
in threads. If you open files with the same name in multiple
threads, the behavior is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have
files opened for read in your main program, they will be
closed in threads. This is also the case for stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have
files opened for write in your main program, they will
continue to be open in threads. However, there is <i>no
guarantee</i> that the writes from different threads are
going to be separated. In fact, it is typically the case
that writes from different threads will be mixed, even if
you use <b>fflush</b>. This behavior is also happening for
stdout and stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The readline
statement as well as the readloop read the line from their
input into a buffer that by default is 2050 bytes long. If
the actual line is longer than 2050 bytes, it will be
truncated and an error will be printed. The buffer can be
increased using the <b>--readbuffer</b> option to
rwloadsim.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In previous
versions of rwloadsim, only the <b>:=</b> assignment
operator existed and the contents of the concatenation was
interpreted to open for read, write, append or as pipelines.
The actual operation was chosen by having an initial
&quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;, &quot;|&quot; or a
final &quot;|&quot; in the concatenation. There is a
security concern with this, and it is therefore deprecated
and will be desupported in release 3.1. As of version 3.0.6
you will get a warning for the deprecated usage.</p>
