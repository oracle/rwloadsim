.SH NAME
rwlman \- RWP*Load Simulator persec table and persec_a view

procedure per second since the common start time.

.SH COLUMNS
\fBrunnumber\fR
.RS 4
This is the number that uniquely identifies a run.
.RE
.P
\fBprocno pcount\fR
.RS 4
In single process runs, procno is zero, in multi-process runs, it gets its value from the Operating
System process number of from the -p option to rwloadsim.  
In the aggregate view, persec_a, the total process count is in the pcount column.
.RE
.P
\fBvname\fR
.RS 4
This is the name of the procedure being executed.
.RE
.P
\fBsecond\fR
.RS 4
This is the whole second after the common start time.
.RE
.P
\fBscount\fR
.RS 4
Total number of executions of the procedure in the latest second until the value of the
.B second
column.
In the persec_a view the value is aggregated over all processes.
.RE
.P
\fBwtime\fR
.RS 4
Total time spent getting a session from a pool for all executions of the procedure
in the latest second until the value of the
.B second
column.
In the persec_a view the value is aggregated over all processes.
If not using a pool, the value is 0.
.RE
.P
\fBetime\fR
.RS 4
Total time spent executing the procedure in the latest second until the value of the
.B second
column.
In the persec_a view the value is aggregated over all processes.
.RE
.P
\fBatime, dtime\fR
.RS 4
Application and database time spent executing the procedure in the latest
second until the value of the
.B second
column.
In the persec_a view the values are aggregated over all processes.
.P
See runres(1rwl) for details about these two columns.
.RE
.SH NOTES
The per second counts and times are like all other statistics held in memory buffers,
and is flushed to the repository database just before rwloadsim termination.
If the --flush-every option is used, the per second values will be flushed every so often,
which can e.g. be used to show a running graph of the throughput.
Note that --flush-every has overheads as mutexes are needed to protect the buffers and 
due to the execution of a sql statement against the repository database.
If the value for the --flush-every option is larger than 1, each update to the repository will
contain per second counts for multiple seconds.
