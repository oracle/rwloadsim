.TH rwlerror "1rwl" "July 2022" "RWP*Load Simulator" "Program Syntax"
.SH NAME
rwlerror \- Provide details about an error from the RWP*Load Simulator
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrwlerror [nn ...]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
If RWP*Load Simulator finds an error during parse or execute, it will generate
an error message with an RWL- error number, location and error text.
The location consists of file name and line number between square brackets;
if there is a call stack, the left most file name and line number is the deepest
location in the stack.
The error text is a short description of the error.
To get further details about the error, use the rwlerror program.
.P
An example of an error is
.P
RWL-022: error at [div.rwl;5]<-[calldiv.rwl;8]: attempted division by zero
.P
which tells that at line 5 in the file div.rwl a division by zero was attempted;
this location is in a procedure that was called from line 8 in the file calldiv.rwl.
.P
Note that in most cases, operation \fIcontinues\fR after an execution error, which potentially
leads to further errors.
.SH USAGE
You simply provide one or more RWL- error numbers as arguments to \fBrwlerror\fR.
You can optionally prefix the number with RWL-.
.SH EXAMPLE
As an example, if you execute \fCrwlerror RWL-001 99 22\fR, the output will be:
.P
.RS 4
