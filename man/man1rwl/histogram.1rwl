.SH NAME
histogram \- RWP*Load Simulator histogram table and histogram_a, fractiles views
.SH DECLARATION
The 
.B histogram
table and associated views show the distribution of total execution time,
which is the sum of the time spent waiting for a session and the time
spent execution the actual code of the procedure,
over a series of "buckets", each being twice is wide as the previous one.

.SH COLUMNS
\fBrunnumber\fR
.RS 4
This is the number that uniquely identifies a run.
.RE
.P
\fBprocno pcount\fR
.RS 4
In single process runs, procno is zero, in multi-process runs, it gets its value from the Operating
System process number or from the -p option to rwloadsim.  
In the aggregate view, histogram_a, the total process count is in the pcount column.
.RE
.P
\fBvname\fR
.RS 4
This is the name of the procedure being executed.
.RE
.P
\fBbuckno\fR
.RS 4
The number of this bucket.
.RE
.P
\fBbucktim\fR
.RS 4
This bucket covers the range from 0.5*bucktim until bucktim, except
the first bucket that covers all positive number until bucktim.
.RE
.P
\fBbcount\fR
.RS 4
Number of executions that has a time within the range of this bucket.
.RE
.P
\fBttime\fR
.RS 4
Total time of all executions that are within the range of this bucket.
.RE
.P
\fBatime\fR
.RS 4
Average time of all executions that are within the range of this bucket.
.RE
.P
\fBfractile\fR
.RS 4
The percentage of executions that are at least as fast as bucktim.
