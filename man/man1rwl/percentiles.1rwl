The

view shows execution time limits for different percentiles of executions of
each procedure; the values can be compared to typical service level agreements
stating that a certain percentage of executions must be faster than some limit.
The time is the sum of the time spent waiting for a session and the time
spent executing the actual code of the procedure.
The time limits for 50%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.8%, 99.9% and 99.95% of executions are
present in the view.
