.SH NAME
sqlid2file.rwl \- Extract sql text from gv$sql or dba_hist_sqltext
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrwloadsim -u -l u/p@c sqlid2file.rwl sqlid ... \fR
.P
For each provided sqlid, the sqlid2file.rwl utility extracts sql text from either gv$sql
or dba_hist_sqltext 
and writes the text to a file named with the sqlid and a suffix of .rws.
The file can subsequently be used in sql declarations in rwl programs
with the result that the sqlid when executing from rwloadsim is 
.I the same
sqlid that was originally executed against the database.
You must provide for your rwl program using the sql to provide any necessary
bind variables and/or defines for queries.
